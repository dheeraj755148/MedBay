### Objective
Deep into the 4th decade of the 21st century, the world witnesses drastic devastation brought about by the 3rd of the worldly wars. The nuclear countries of the world used all their unfortunate might, to find an end to the distraught brought about but as the weapons of genocide unveiled, they brought an end to life as we know it. Humans no more could live on land but learnt to adapt to life in the deep sea. Being one of the top few engineers who had seen this relocation coming, you've taken on the task to connect people by developing websites for the basic units of a civilization.

## The site aims to give valuable medicines to their door steps. Lets fight it together...
